# TESTING RULES (Backend)

- Prefer unit tests for domain/application logic.
- Integration tests for API routing/DI/db boundaries.
- When changing behavior, update:
  - unit tests (if logic changed)
  - integration tests (if endpoints/contracts changed)
- Always show how to run relevant tests:
  - `cd backend && pytest ...`
